# NaiveBayes_in_Python
  Implementation of NaiveBayes algorithm for pattern classification on iris data.

    Naivebayes algorithm from scratch making a class and writing some functions.---- 95-97 %
    Implementation using sklearn. ---- 93-95 %
    ---> My implementation performed as good as the sklearn library.
